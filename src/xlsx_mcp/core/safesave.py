"""Slot-based backup rotation + per-file write serialization for the save path.

Ported from KitchenSink4Word core/safesave.py, the SAFETY CORE foundation
(DESIGN Section 3.2, backup-before-mutation). The logic is format-agnostic;
only the backup-folder name (.ks4w-backups -> .ks4xl-backups), the slot file
extension (.docx -> .xlsx), the error base (WordMcpError -> XlMcpError), and
the process name in the lock-timeout message changed. Everything else is the
proven two-slot hardlink design.

Backup model:

- A hidden ``.ks4xl-backups/`` folder sits next to each mutated workbook
  (dot-prefix everywhere; FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN is additionally set on
  Windows, non-fatal if that fails).
- Inside it, one subfolder per workbook (the workbook's own file name,
  hash-suffixed when the name is very long; Korean/unicode names work).
- Exactly two stable slots per workbook (SLOT_POLICY below):
    ``prev.xlsx``   - state before the most recent mutation, rotates every call
    ``anchor.xlsx`` - session-start state, rotates only when the workbook has
                      been idle ANCHOR_IDLE_SECONDS or more, measured from the
                      prev slot's mtime (no state database).
  (The slot extension is cosmetic: restore copies the slot bytes back onto
  the original path regardless of the source's real extension, so an .xlsm
  source is preserved intact in a prev.xlsx slot.)
- Rotation mechanism (crash-window-free): HARDLINK the current target file to
  a temp name inside the slot folder, then os.replace that link onto the slot.
  The workbook is NEVER absent from its own path at any instant. Hardlink
  failure (non-NTFS, cloud placeholders, cross-volume) falls back to
  shutil.copy2. Link/replace calls are retried with backoff to ride out
  transient AV sharing violations.

Write serialization (fixes the parallel read-modify-save race):

- ``write_lock(path)`` context manager, held across the FULL
  read-modify-validate-save cycle of a mutation.
- In-process: one threading.RLock per file, keyed on
  normcase(realpath(path)).
- Cross-process: an advisory lockfile inside the workbook's slot folder
  carrying PID + timestamp. Stale locks (dead PID, or older than
  LOCK_STALE_SECONDS) are broken; otherwise acquisition waits up to
  LOCK_WAIT_SECONDS and then refuses with MutationLockTimeout naming the
  holder.
