"""Is a newer KitchenSink4XL published? A check-on-demand version report.

The family spec (identical in KS4W, KS4P, and KS4XL, modulo the package and
variable names):

- CHECK ON DEMAND ONLY. Nothing runs at import, nothing runs at server
  startup, no thread, no scheduler. The one call that can reach the network
  is status(), and exactly one tool calls it: the server's info/diagnostic
  surface. Every other tool path reads the cache or nothing at all.
- It asks PyPI's public JSON endpoint for the package it was installed
  from, at most once every seven days. The answer is cached in a tiny JSON
  file under the server's own state directory, never beside a user's
  documents.
- Two seconds or nothing. A timeout, a network error, or a malformed
  payload never raises and never blocks; it is RECORDED and REPORTED, with
  the reason and the age of the last answer that did arrive. The report is
  honest about not knowing rather than silent.
- The PyPI payload is untrusted input. Comparison uses packaging.version,
  is prerelease-aware (a prerelease is never offered to a stable build),
  and anything unparseable yields "unknown", never a fabricated version.
- OFF SWITCH: KS4XL_UPDATE_CHECK=off disables the whole thing (no network
  call, no cache read, no cache write); the surface then says so. The
  older KS4XL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1 still disables it too.
- PRIVACY: the check is one plain HTTPS GET to pypi.org. It sends nothing
  but the request itself: no document, no path, no identifier, no
  telemetry. The payload discloses this the first time it runs.
- The server never downloads, installs, or executes anything. It reports
  version numbers and facts.
