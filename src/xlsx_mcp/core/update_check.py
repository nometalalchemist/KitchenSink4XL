"""Is a newer KitchenSink4XL published? A quiet, opt-out startup check.

The family spec (identical in KS4W, KS4P, KS4XL, and KS4Web, modulo the
package and variable names):

- The check runs in a BACKGROUND daemon thread started after the server is
  built, so it can never delay serving. Nothing waits on it.
- It asks PyPI's public JSON endpoint for the package it was installed
  from, at most once every 14 days. The answer is cached in a tiny JSON
  file under the server's own state directory, never beside a user's
  documents.
- Failure is silence. Timeouts (3 seconds), network errors, and malformed
  payloads are swallowed; nothing reaches stderr and nothing reaches the
  caller. A failed attempt IS recorded, with a 1-day retry horizon, so an
  offline machine is neither hammered nor stuck forever.
- Comparison uses packaging.version and is prerelease-aware: a prerelease
  is never offered to somebody running a stable build.
- The result surfaces as ONE line in get_server_info() and nowhere else. No
  startup banner, no per-call nagging.
- KS4XL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1 (or "true") disables the whole thing: no network
  call, no cache read, no cache write.
- The server never downloads, installs, or executes anything. It reports a
  version number and the command a human can run.
