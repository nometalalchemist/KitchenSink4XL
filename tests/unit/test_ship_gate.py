"""THE PRE-SHIP GREP GATE: a check that reads the artifact.

Every publishing defect the 2026-09-08 audit found was catchable by one
grep, and not one of them was caught, because what got checked was the
report about the file rather than the file. An order was given, an agent
reported compliance, and nobody opened the manifest. This is the check that
opens it.

Five patterns, all of them things that mean "somebody was still working
here" and none of them things a stranger should ever read:

- ``COPY PENDING`` and ``FACTS TO CONVEY``, the build's own instructions to
  a future writer. Six of these shipped on a sibling's install screen.
- ``PLACEHOLDER``, the marker this product was printing at users out of its
  update-check strings until the 2026-09-09 copy fill wave replaced them.
- The em dash, banned across every public surface in every language.
- A ``user_config`` entry typed anything but ``boolean``. The install screen
  is checkboxes; a free-text box is a typo waiting to break somebody's
  install, and the manifest schema has no enum type that would make one
  safe. ``EXEMPT_TYPED_FIELDS`` names the one field the author ruled an
  exception, and naming it here is what keeps the exception from spreading.
- An absolute ``C:\\Users\\`` path, which is a build that only runs on the
  machine that built it.

SCOPE. Everything in ``ENFORCED`` is clean of all five as of the commit
that adds this file, so the gate is green the day it lands and every hit
after that is a regression. ``docs/index.html`` joined that list on
2026-09-09, after four landing pages shipped figures their own READMEs
contradicted; the published-figure guard at the bottom of this file
covers the same class from the other direction. The ``src/`` trees are
deliberately NOT in scope: the em dashes in their refusal strings are an
author decision, not a gate decision. This is the KS4Web gate (``tests/unit/
test_ship_gate.py`` there), ported by the 2026-09-09 copy fill wave so the
family is checked by one rule rather than by one product's discipline.
