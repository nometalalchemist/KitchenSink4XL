"""Guard: every tool declares whether it can change anything, and no
tool that can change something claims it cannot.

Claude Desktop groups tools by readOnlyHint and offers the read-only
group a single Always Allow. That makes a wrong hint a permission bug
rather than a documentation nit, so two things are checked here.

The allowlist below is hand-audited and lives in the TEST on purpose.
core/readonly.py is where the server reads its classification from; if
both sides shared one list the test would only prove the file equals
itself. A new tool consequently fails twice until someone classifies it
deliberately: once at import, where read_only_hint raises on an unknown
name, and once here.

The second guard catches a WRONG classification rather than a missing
one. It walks the call graph out of each read-only tool and fails if it
reaches a save, a file write, a temporary file, or the DispatchEx that
starts a hidden Excel. The walk treats a few infrastructure modules as
leaves, named and justified below, because they create lock directories
and read process tables without ever touching a workbook.
